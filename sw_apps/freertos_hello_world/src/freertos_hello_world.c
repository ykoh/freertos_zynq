 GNU General Public License Exception

 Any FreeRTOS source code, whether modified or in its original release form,
 or whether in whole or in part, can only be distributed by you under the
 terms of the GNU General Public License plus this exception. An independent
 module is a module which is not derived from or based on FreeRTOS.

 EXCEPTION TEXT:

 Clause 1

 Linking FreeRTOS statically or dynamically with other modules is making a
 combined work based on FreeRTOS. Thus, the terms and conditions of the
 GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

 As a special exception, the copyright holder of FreeRTOS gives you permission
 to link FreeRTOS with independent modules that communicate with FreeRTOS
 solely through the FreeRTOS API interface, regardless of the license terms
 of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting
 combined work under terms of your choice, provided that

 Every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a written statement that
 details to the recipient the version of FreeRTOS used and an offer by
 yourself to provide the FreeRTOS source code (including any modifications
 you may have  made) should the recipient request it.
 The combined work is not itself an RTOS, scheduler, kernel or related product.
 The independent modules add significant and primary functionality to FreeRTOS
 and do not merely extend the existing functionality already present
 in FreeRTOS.

 Clause 2

 FreeRTOS may not be used for any competitive or comparative purpose,
 including the publication of any form of run time or compile time metric,
 without the express permission of Real Time Engineers Ltd. (this is the norm
 within the industry and is intended to ensure information accuracy).
